            Here's a fun story - I started out as a Mechanical Engineer in 2021.
            While everyone was figuring out their next move, I stumbled upon
            FreeCodeCamp and dove into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Something just
            clicked. Those early programming classes from school (Java in 10th
            and C++ in 12th) suddenly started making a lot more sense.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Joined a bootcamp at JSPiders for full-stack development, and three
            months later, believe it or not, landed my first tech job at Wipro
            through... Instagram! That's where I first met React, building my
            first landing page with YouTube tutorials as my guide. Then came the
            real challenge - a Wells Fargo project migrating internal WebForms
            applications to modern Angular and React frontends.

          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            They even threw me into leading an application rewrite (spoiler
            alert: it was a beautiful disaster). But hey, nothing teaches you
            more than a good old-fashioned failure, right? Learned tons about
            frontend architecture, time management, and what real efficiency
            looks like in the process.

            Now I'm at IBM, working on their flagship Carbon Design System. From
            watching tutorial videos to maintaining a design system used by
            thousands of developers - it's been quite a ride. And the best part?
            I'm just getting started.
